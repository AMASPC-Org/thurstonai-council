Please execute the following updates across the entire website design and content:

I. Website Structure & Navigation:

Refine 'The Inaugural Summit' Page Content:

Relocate the 'Become an Inaugural Summit Sponsor' and 'Speak at a Future Event' sections (currently found on the 'Get Involved' page) to be prominent sections directly on 'The Inaugural Summit' page.

Ensure these sections have clear calls-to-action with buttons: 'Learn More About Sponsorship' and 'Become a Speaker'.

Create New 'Partnership Opportunities' Page:

Build out a new page for the 'Partnership Opportunities' button (currently on the 'Get Involved' page).

This new page should go beyond event sponsorship. It should outline various ways organizations can collaborate with the Thurston AI Business Council, including:

An overview of partner benefits.

A summary or link back to event sponsorship.

Opportunities for content/research collaboration.

Program or initiative partnerships.

A clear call-to-action or contact form for partnership inquiries.

II. Frontend Button Functionality (Linking):

For ALL existing call-to-action buttons across the site (e.g., 'Reserve Your Seat', 'Learn More About Sponsorship', 'Become a Speaker', the new 'Partnership Opportunities' button, etc.), ensure they are no longer static placeholders.

Each button should correctly link to its respective detail page or form. Create basic, placeholder content for any newly linked pages (e.g., a simple 'Sponsorship Details' page, 'Speaker Application Form' page, and the 'Partnership Opportunities' page) to demonstrate the functionality.

III. Ad Copy & Content Updates (As Previously Discussed):

Homepage Banner Section (Main Call-to-Action):

Primary Headline (remains the same): 'Navigating the AI Future of Thurston County. Together.'

Sub-headline/Body Text:

Replace existing paragraph: 'The Thurston AI Business Council, a community-led initiative, invites local leaders to our Inaugural Summit 2026. Join us for a concise, high-impact 90-minute event featuring a dynamic keynote and an expert cross-sector panel, designed to equip you with immediate, actionable AI insights for your business. Secure your place now for just $25. Scholarships are available upon request.'

Call-to-Action Button: 'Reserve Your Seat' (remains the same)

Homepage 'Join Us for the Inaugural Summit' Section:

Headline (remains the same): 'Join Us for the Inaugural Summit'

Body Text (below date/time):

Update: 'This 90-minute, high-impact event is a critical step for businesses looking to thrive in the AI era. Secure your attendance for just $25. Scholarships available.'

Call-to-Action Button: 'Learn More & Register' (remains the same)

'The Inaugural Summit' Page (Main Event Details/Overview):

Event Description/Overview Paragraph (near the top):

Revise: 'Join the Thurston AI Business Council for its Inaugural Summit 2026, a focused 90-minute event designed for local business, government, education, and healthcare leaders. This impactful summit will feature a leading keynote speaker and an expert cross-sector panel providing immediate, actionable insights into AI's opportunities and challenges within Thurston County. Don't miss this essential event for just $25. Scholarships are available to ensure broad community access.'

'The Inaugural Summit' Page (Event Agenda Section):

Update the Expert Panel Entry:

Title: 'Expert Panel: AI in Thurston County: Cross-Sector Perspectives'

Description: 'Hear from leaders across government, education, healthcare, and business as they discuss real-world AI implementation, challenges, and opportunities specific to Thurston County. Featuring representatives from Government, Education, Healthcare, and Business sectors, moderated by [Your Name/Placeholder].'

Ensure 'Breakout Sessions' are removed from the agenda, and timings are adjusted for a 90-minute flow.

IV. General Website Aesthetics:

Maintain the existing professional, clean, and modern aesthetic with the deep tech blue, dark gray, and white color palette.

Ensure the Thurston AI Business Council logo (the icon combining the Capitol Dome, Mount Rainier, and AI) is prominently featured in the header of all pages.

V. Backend Functionality Notes (for future build phase - not a design prompt):

Specify the requirement for an integrated ticketing system capable of handling both $25 paid registrations and a scholarship/free registration option.

Ensure mechanisms for payment processing, automated confirmations, and attendee management are included in the build specifications."

This single prompt covers all your requested design, content, and linking updates, and also clarifies the path for the Partnership Opportunities page.
